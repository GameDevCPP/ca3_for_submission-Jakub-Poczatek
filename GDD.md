# Introduction #
This is the game design document for the game, "Second Thoughts". Second Thoughts is a 2D side-scroller platformer action game. 

# WIP Ideas #
- the player is able to leave the level at any point, but if conditions are not met, the level will loop.
- Condition: Collect item
- Every level, enemies amount will increase
- For every enemy the player kills, their speed will decrease by 5%
- Final level will only be beatable if the player has spared at least 3/4 of the enemies
- Maybe top down???
